# Global Car Accident Analysis
I analyzed global car accident data using Plotly in Python to create interactive visualizations. The project highlights disparities in road safety across different countries and continents. Key findings include higher road death rates in the U.S. compared to other countries and the impact of larger, more powerful vehicles on accident severity. The visualizations emphasize the urgent need for enhanced road safety measures worldwide.

## Project Overview 
My project focuses on the global analysis of car accidents, utilizing Plotly in Python to create interactive visualizations. By examining car accident data across different countries and continents, the project aims to highlight the disparities in road safety and the factors contributing to accidents. The visualizations reveal key insights, such as the higher rate of road deaths in the U.S. compared to other countries, and the impact of vehicle size and performance on accident severity. The project underscores the urgent need for improved road safety measures worldwide.

### Dataset Description: 
The dataset used in this project includes columns for the year, location, indicator, subject, frequency, registered vehicles, variable, unit, and car accidents. It spans from 2010 to 2021 and covers various countries, focusing on passenger cars. Each row represents data for a specific year and country, detailing the number of registered vehicles and recorded car accidents. This dataset provides critical insights into global car accident trends and patterns, enabling an in-depth analysis of factors contributing to road safety issues across different regions.

## Key Findings

### Car Accidents by Continent between 2010 to 2021 
- Europe experiences the highest number of car accidents between 2010 to 2021, ranging from 67,000 to 120,000.
- Oceania has the least number of car accidents between 2010 to 2021, ranging from 7,000 to 20,000.

## Conclusion
"We face a crisis here in America,‚Äù White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told Yahoo News last month, pointing out that the number of people who died on the roads each year (42,795 in 2022) is comparable to the number killed by guns (48,830 in 2021). Americans drive more, which leads to more crashes, on roads that facilitate unsafe driving. On average, Americans drive more than twice as many miles as the French, more than three times as many as the Japanese and far more than even the residents of neighboring Canada have many more road deaths per capita in comparison to Germany and the U.K.
