# Global Car Accident Analysis
I analyzed global car accident data using Plotly in Python to create interactive visualizations. The project highlights disparities in road safety across different countries and continents. Key findings include higher road death rates in the U.S. compared to other countries and the impact of larger, more powerful vehicles on accident severity. The visualizations emphasize the urgent need for enhanced road safety measures worldwide.

## Project Overview 
My project focuses on the global analysis of car accidents, utilizing Plotly in Python to create interactive visualizations. By examining car accident data across different countries and continents, the project aims to highlight the disparities in road safety and the factors contributing to accidents. The visualizations reveal key insights, such as the higher rate of road deaths in the U.S. compared to other countries, and the impact of vehicle size and performance on accident severity. The project underscores the urgent need for improved road safety measures worldwide.
