# Global Car Accident Analysis

## Project Overview 
My project focuses on the global analysis of car accidents, utilizing Plotly in Python to create interactive visualizations. By examining car accident data across different countries and continents, the project aims to highlight the disparities in road safety and the factors contributing to accidents. The visualizations reveal key insights, such as the higher rate of road deaths in the U.S. compared to other countries, and the impact of vehicle size and performance on accident severity. The project underscores the urgent need for improved road safety measures worldwide.
